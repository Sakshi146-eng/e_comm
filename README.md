Next.js E-commerce Product Catalog: Full-Stack Rendering DemonstrationThis project is a small e-commerce product catalog built using Next.js 14 (App Router) and TypeScript. It serves as a full-stack demonstration, focusing specifically on implementing and justifying the core Next.js rendering strategies: SSG, ISR, SSR, and CSR.Submission DetailsCreated by: $$Insert Your Full Name Here$$ on October 30, 2025ðŸš€ Project Setup and Running InstructionsThis project uses a simple local JSON file (data/products.json) as a mock database.Clone the Repository:git clone [YOUR-REPO-LINK]
cd nextjs-ecommerce
Install Dependencies:npm install
Configure Environment Variables (.env.local):Create a file named .env.local in the root directory based on the .env.example. This key is required to authorize POST and PUT requests on the Admin panel.# .env.local
ADMIN_API_KEY=your-secret-key-here
Run the Development Server (with Next.js/Turbopack):npm run dev
The application will be accessible at: http://localhost:3000.ðŸ’¡ Rendering Strategies by RouteThe application is architected to use the most efficient rendering method for each route's content and access requirements.RouteStrategyRationale/ (Home Page)SSG (Static Site Generation)Achieves maximum speed for public content. Data is fetched at build time. Client-Side Rendering (CSR) is used for filtering functionality./products/[slug]ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)Combines static speed with data freshness. Pages are pre-rendered but revalidate every 60 seconds to update stock or price changes./dashboardSSR (Server-Side Rendering)Forces data to be fetched on every request (export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'). Essential for displaying critical, real-time inventory statistics and alerts./adminCSR (Client-Side Rendering)Optimal for highly interactive, authenticated pages. All forms and data manipulation (POST, PUT) are handled asynchronously by client-side React code./recommendationsHybrid (Server/Client)(Bonus) Data is fetched by a Server Component for efficiency, while the interactive element (Add to Wishlist) is handled by a Client Component.ðŸ’¾ Database Setup (Mock)Data is persisted using a local JSON file: data/products.json.Setup: No external setup is required. The lib/db.ts file uses Node.js's fs module to read and write to this file directly, simulating a database connection.Seeding: The file is pre-seeded with initial product data. Changes made via the Admin Panel will be written back to this file immediately.
